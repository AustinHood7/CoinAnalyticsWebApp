# CoinAnalyticsWebApp

Created by: Jake Hanson, Christian Apostoli, Austin Hood

This is a web application that fetches data on various types of crypto coins and displays the data in the form of a graph and raw data.
We will be using react.js, bootstrap, and api, flask, and a database to make the full tech stack for this application.
